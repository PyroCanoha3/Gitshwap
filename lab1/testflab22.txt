On the military road
I walked in struggle and anxiety
The eighteenth year of combat.
The fees were short-lived
From Kuban to Volga
We were raising horses for a hike.

Amidst the heat and dust
BUDYONNY and I went
On the trot for big things.
Along the humpbacked mounds
Along the river rifts
Our great fame has passed.
